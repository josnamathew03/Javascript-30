        console.log(players,team)  // team is not the original array it is reference to some other aray, so when we change it we are changing the otriginal array, we can make a copy of an aray and then update it
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        const teams1 = Array.from(players)
    // one way
        const team2 = players.slice() // splice without any argunkent return that aray itself
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        team4[4]= 'heeeeee'
        console.log(team4,players)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const man = person
    man.number = 99
    console.log(man,person)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
     const man2 = Object.assign({},person,{number : 100, age:12})
     console.log(man2,person)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const man3= {...person}
    console.log(man3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
